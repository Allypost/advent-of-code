# Advent of Code 2018

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2018 challenges.
Most scripts are cobbled together monstrosities but, in my opinion, that's part of the charm.

## How to run
1. Clone the repo
2. Run the good ol' `npm install`
3. Edit the cookie.txt with your `session` cookie value from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
4. Run `npm start` and it should fetch the inputs and solve the challenges day by day
5. (OPTIONAL) You can run `npm start` with a list (either space or comma separated) of days to run (eg. `npm start 5 13` or `npm start 5,13` to run just challenges for days 5 and 13)
